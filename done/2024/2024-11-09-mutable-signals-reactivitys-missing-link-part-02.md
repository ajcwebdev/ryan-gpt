## Episode Description

A wide-ranging conversation that examines how mutable and immutable signals shape modern reactive programming, touching on performance, data flow, async patterns, and real-world frameworks.

## Episode Summary

This discussion explores the foundations of reactivity, focusing on the relationship between mutable and immutable signals. It begins by introducing core concepts—like how signals, memos, and stores function—and clarifies the differences between immutable updates that replace entire data structures and mutable updates that alter data in place. The conversation emphasizes how granular reactivity allows for more efficient updates and discusses how developers can manage deeper nested data, list transformations, and derived structures without resorting to excessive computation. The talk also tackles async handling, suspense mechanisms, and the tricky balance between immediate versus lazy fetching. By illustrating real-world examples and dissecting trade-offs in various frameworks, the session highlights the importance of understanding both the underlying architecture of reactivity and the practical techniques that developers can use to build performant, maintainable applications.

## Chapters

### 02:36:00 - Impact on Developer Ergonomics

Ryan reflects on how these advanced data-handling techniques can intimidate newer developers. He mentions that many people come from React or simpler libraries that push immutability by default. While store-based reactivity can be more powerful and efficient, it demands a deeper understanding of references, merges, and partial updates. He advocates for good documentation and patterns that guide devs away from common pitfalls.

He highlights that some frameworks hide these complexities by either re-rendering everything or restricting the user to immutability. Solid and similar libraries leave the door open for more optimized updates. But that freedom means it’s easier to create ambiguous code if you misunderstand the system. This underscores a continuous tension: frameworks can’t handle every case automatically, so devs must pick strategies aligning with their app’s data flow requirements.

### 02:42:00 - Revisiting Suspense and Transitions

The topic shifts back to transitions and suspense, with Ryan reaffirming that adopting them requires clarity about partial states. He notes that some devs prefer to avoid fallback placeholders or entire loading screens, opting instead for local guards. However, if you deeply chain async calls, suspense may be the cleanest solution to avoid repeated fetches or partial info. The approach depends on user experience goals.

He references React’s concurrency once more, pointing out that Solid takes a different route, focusing on synchronous consistency. Devs can emulate concurrency-like transitions using specialized methods, but the default remains straightforward. The conversation underscores how these design decisions revolve around user expectations. If the app can gracefully show partial data, no full fallback is needed; otherwise, a broad suspense can unify everything behind a single loading boundary.

### 02:48:00 - Handling Run-Once Logic and Waterfall Cases

Ryan outlines a scenario where multiple dependent async calls can trigger unwanted sequential fetching if each step waits for the previous one. He explores the idea of “run once” logic, where all fetches begin simultaneously. However, it leads to complexities if the data shape itself changes mid-fetch. This might fetch outdated or mismatched details if you rely on stale references.

He concedes that while run-once or lazy strategies sound appealing, real-world code often needs more explicit checks: if the user changed ID, don’t use old data. Or if the best friend property changed, re-fetch that relationship. The final conclusion is that developers must weigh the cost of potential double-fetching against user experience. In many apps, either concurrency or local guards are simpler to manage than strictly lazy, single-run approaches.

### 02:54:00 - Summarizing Reactive Systems Trade-Offs

As the first hour concludes, Ryan consolidates major themes: ephemeral re-renders, keyed vs. non-keyed data, the complexities of merges, and the subtleties of lazy fetching. He stresses that reactivity is more than a simple function signature; it involves event queues, concurrency decisions, and data consistency checks. Each design choice either simplifies or complicates a different aspect of application development.

He reiterates his guiding philosophy: give developers granular control by default, with carefully chosen primitives that can scale from small interactive widgets to large enterprise dashboards. This approach leads to some intricacies that simpler frameworks gloss over, but it delivers unmatched performance and flexibility when done right. By the end of this chapter, listeners have a solid grounding in the main moving parts that define advanced reactive architectures.

### 03:00:00 - Exploring Resource APIs and Loading States

Ryan begins the second hour by delving into resource-based APIs in Solid, reminiscent of React Query or other data-fetching libraries. He explains that a resource might auto-fetch data on initialization, returning signals for pending or error states. However, Solid’s approach keeps reading consistent with signal-based reactivity, so you can easily combine them with store logic or local signals.

He acknowledges that some have requested direct loading indicators, but implementing them universally can reintroduce tearing if partial data is reused. Devs must decide whether to display stale data or revert to a waiting state. Ryan points to specialized flags—like `.latest` or `.loading`—that can guide transitions, noting that the full solution might differ in the next major release. This segment foreshadows further deep dives into versioning and concurrency.

### 03:06:00 - Reflecting on the Memory Model for Effects

Turning more internal, Ryan covers how Solid manages nested effects. When an effect triggers another effect, the system tracks ownership to avoid memory leaks. He notes that older libraries like Knockout or MobX occasionally suffered from cyclical references, but Solid’s approach releases child effects when parents re-run or get disposed, preventing leaks. This ensures the reactivity graph remains stable even as components mount and unmount.

He compares it to Angular’s “zones” or Svelte’s auto-disposal for scoped reactivity. The main lesson: well-designed reactivity frameworks handle lifecycle events gracefully. By tying effect creation to a parent’s context, Solid automatically cleans up when that parent re-renders or unmounts. Ryan emphasizes that while devs seldom see these internals, they matter greatly for long-lived apps that frequently restructure their data or UI.

### 03:12:00 - Potential Enhancements to Suspense and Transactions

Ryan recaps that transitions or concurrency can unify large updates behind a single transaction, preventing partial states from leaking into the UI. He touches on advanced patterns: for instance, if you batch multiple signals, Solid can process them collectively, then render once. This resembles React’s “startTransition,” though Solid’s underlying model is simpler. The conversation underscores that these enhancements aim to reduce choppy updates for better user experiences.

He also remarks on dev tools that might let you see how signals change over time, offering better insight into the update flow. Debugging complex concurrency in reactivity often requires specialized tools that track effect executions. By pushing boundaries around concurrency, Solid hopes to keep code straightforward while offering advanced scheduling for heavy computations or big data merges.

### 03:18:00 - Angular, Svelte, and Convergent Directions

Ryan highlights how Angular’s new signal work, Svelte’s reactivity improvements, and Vue’s composition API indicate a broader industry shift. All major frameworks now incorporate a fine-grained approach to state. He notes that while the exact syntax differs—Angular uses decorators, Svelte uses a compiler, Vue uses proxies—the shared aim is to avoid global re-renders. This signals a consensus that granular updates yield performance wins.

He chuckles about the repeated jokes that every library is “becoming React,” clarifying that they differ in behavior more than appearance. Svelte’s upcoming changes, for example, rely heavily on compile-time transformations, whereas Solid uses a runtime engine. In the end, a developer’s choice might hinge on familiarity or ecosystem concerns. Ryan suggests that, from a reactivity standpoint, the lines are blurring, with all frameworks moving toward more granular tracking of data changes.

### 03:24:00 - Reflecting on Syntax vs. Semantics

Ryan acknowledges that syntactic preferences—like whether signals are accessed with a function call or `.value`—often spark heated debate, yet they’re relatively superficial. The truly important difference is whether you treat state as fine-grained or do large, coarse updates. He insists that while syntax can shape developer ergonomics, it doesn’t dictate the underlying engine’s capabilities.

He references heated online discussions regarding Svelte’s new block syntax, pointing out that people sometimes conflate syntax changes with deeper architectural shifts. Ryan concludes that it’s crucial to differentiate “looks like React” from “behaves like React.” Svelte’s runes, Solid’s signals, and Vue’s refs may look similar in code snippets, yet they differ in how they schedule and batch updates. Understanding that helps developers pick tools based on real architecture, not just surface aesthetics.

### 03:30:00 - Community Perceptions and Ecosystem Hurdles

The conversation touches on developer adoption and how community sentiment can overshadow technical merits. Ryan observes that many devs fear migrating to a smaller ecosystem, worrying about limited hiring prospects or less comprehensive library support. He notes that Svelte, Solid, and Vue all face this in comparison to React. Yet these frameworks continuously grow and accumulate enough community resources to tackle most real needs.

He expresses gratitude for contributors producing guides, libraries, and components in the Solid ecosystem, which helps ease adoption. Over time, momentum builds as frameworks refine their capabilities, but some devs remain cautious. Ryan suggests that as major companies integrate these newer frameworks into production, more devs will see the potential. This interplay between perceived stability, community size, and advanced feature sets remains a universal theme in JS framework discussions.

### 03:36:00 - Cross-Platform Interests and Native Targets

Ryan points out that Solid, Vue, and Svelte each see expansions into mobile or desktop platforms via NativeScript, Tauri, or other bridges. Such cross-platform efforts can spark corporate interest because they unify code across device types. He mentions that memory usage or performance constraints on embedded devices or TV apps might favor these smaller, more efficient frameworks.

He notes success stories where Solid’s minimal overhead suits television-based UIs. As these frameworks prove themselves outside the browser, they gain traction beyond typical web pages. This synergy might further break down the inertia around React, which has a large ecosystem for native. With more options available, companies now weigh whether performance gains justify exploring less mainstream libraries, a shift from years past when React was the default for cross-platform development.

### 03:42:00 - Revisiting Benchmarks and Real-World Value

Ryan discusses how standard benchmarks like JS Framework Benchmark, DBMon, or UI Bench help compare frameworks in extreme scenarios. He highlights that Solid consistently performs near the top due to its fine-grained approach, while frameworks like Svelte also show strong results. These numbers showcase potential speed, but he warns that real apps may see different bottlenecks, such as networking or server constraints, overshadowing raw rendering performance.

He stresses that while micro-benchmarks aren’t everything, they reflect the core architecture’s efficiency. If a framework can handle thousands of rows with minimal overhead, it’s a good sign for complex dashboards or data-heavy tools. However, for simpler apps, devs might value ecosystem depth or personal familiarity more than edge performance. Ryan leaves it to the audience to balance raw speed with practical considerations when picking a framework.

### 03:48:00 - Early Returns and Control Flow in React vs. Solid

Ryan critiques the React pattern of using early returns to handle multiple states in a single component. While it can simplify logic reading, it also drives re-renders up the call stack. By contrast, Solid or Svelte might use specialized control-flow helpers—like `<Show>` or condition blocks—placing logic closer to where data is consumed. This difference in approach underscores fundamental divergences in reactivity handling.

He questions whether early returns are truly simpler, suggesting they can lead to layout duplication or hamper partial updates. Instead, frameworks with granular reactivity often nest conditions within smaller components or dedicated control-flow constructs. The upshot is a more modular approach that sidesteps mass re-renders triggered by if-else logic in a single function body. Ryan sees this as further proof that syntax alone can be deceiving, as design patterns matter more than surface appearance.

### 03:54:00 - Syntax Debates and the “React-Like” Label

Ryan addresses persistent community disputes around frameworks “copying” React whenever they share a functional style. He admits many modern frameworks use a single-file or function-based syntax that looks superficially similar, yet the underlying update mechanics differ. He highlights how enthusiasts often reduce these differences to mere syntax, missing the deeper architectural uniqueness.

He concedes that React popularized a certain mental model, but frameworks like Solid, Svelte, or Vue composition API do more fine-grained work behind the scenes. The result is a broad consensus that function components are ergonomic, but it doesn’t automatically mean they adopt React’s reconciliation strategy. Ryan suggests a more informed conversation that focuses on how each framework schedules updates and handles dependencies, rather than superficial aesthetics.

### 04:00:00 - Overcoming “It’s Not React” Objections

Ryan acknowledges a recurring sentiment: developers might dismiss any non-React framework as niche or risky. He contends that as these alternative libraries mature and prove themselves in production, many “React or nothing” teams become more open-minded. He cites examples where Svelte, Vue, or Solid have quietly powered large-scale apps or embedded systems, reflecting real stability and performance.

He believes that each new iteration—Svelte 5, Vue’s signal enhancements, Solid’s upcoming 2.0—narrows the gap between perceived niche status and mainstream acceptance. Over time, the conversation shifts from “Are they stable?” to “Which approach suits my data flow?” This underscores a more pragmatic perspective: while React remains dominant, other solutions are legitimate choices, especially where performance or simpler reactivity is paramount.

### 04:06:00 - Developer Experience: Syntax vs. Architecture

Ryan reiterates that people often fixate on typing fewer characters or having the neatest file structure. Yet the architecture behind how updates propagate is far more consequential. Minimal typing won’t save you from confusion if your codebase struggles with deeply nested data merges or asynchronous waterfalls. He notes that advanced reactivity can look a bit more verbose initially but often clarifies complex data flows.

He references older controversies around CoffeeScript or Babel, recalling how some devs equated simpler syntax with better code. Over time, ES features normalized these preferences, but the real leaps in developer productivity came from architectural changes, like modules or arrow functions. Similarly, in modern frameworks, syntax is a surface improvement, while deep reactivity is the real game-changer. This sets the stage for concluding thoughts on balancing developer comfort and system design.

### 04:12:00 - Community Projects and Solid Hack

Ryan briefly shifts to mention ongoing community events, referencing a “Solid Hack” competition that encourages participants to create or refine libraries, docs, or guides. He commends the submissions that have come in, highlighting how they fill gaps in the ecosystem. This not only benefits new adopters but also fosters a sense of shared ownership and innovation.

He notes that challenges range from building comprehensive UI libraries to writing in-depth usage guides. These efforts help relieve the knowledge bottleneck around advanced reactivity patterns, letting more developers confidently adopt Solid. By spotlighting hackathon entries, Ryan shows how community contributions can sustain a smaller ecosystem, bridging the gap with larger frameworks that have established documentation or tooling.

### 04:18:00 - Expanding to NativeScript and Tauri

Ryan highlights developments in cross-platform tooling, where Solid’s runtime is integrated with NativeScript for mobile and Tauri for desktop. This approach aims to unify web developers’ skill sets so they can build apps that feel truly native. He alludes to improved memory usage or better performance, essential for constrained environments like older phones or specialized hardware.

He acknowledges that React Native sets a high bar, but smaller frameworks can step in, offering a leaner approach. Tauri’s tighter integration with Rust, for instance, might yield minimal overhead. Even though such projects are in earlier phases compared to the React ecosystem, they demonstrate how the reactivity model can apply well beyond the browser. Ryan sees a bright future if these expansions gain traction among devs needing maximum efficiency.

### 04:24:00 - Reflecting on Community Growth Patterns

Ryan returns to the topic of ecosystem size and adoption. He observes that many developers initially hesitate, waiting for high-profile success stories. Slowly, as more companies share how they used Svelte or Solid in production, the frameworks gain credibility. Ryan thinks that community-driven events—like meetups or hackathons—play a large part in scaling from a hobbyist tool to a recognized professional option.

He discusses the positive feedback loop: more adoption leads to more contributors, which yields better docs and libraries, encouraging further adoption. Over time, the frameworks gain enough momentum to be self-sustaining. Ryan notes that although these libraries might never rival React’s user base, they can comfortably serve a growing niche of teams seeking performance and simpler reactivity. The chapter highlights the social dimension of technology decisions.

### 04:30:00 - Revisiting Data Cloning Pitfalls

Ryan circles back to a technical segment on data cloning. He clarifies that if a framework clones every object for safety, it risks losing identity checks or merging references incorrectly. Conversely, not cloning can cause external code to mutate data behind the framework’s back. This fundamental tension underscores why store or memo APIs sometimes offer hooks for partial merges or reconciling two versions of an object.

He cites real code examples where naive merges led to surprising results—like two different UI elements linked to the same data. This can break user expectations or cause bizarre UI flickers. Ryan stresses that advanced frameworks must refine these edge cases or at least provide well-documented patterns for devs to follow. The conversation doubles down on the notion that deeper knowledge of reactivity’s internals often prevents these painful errors.

### 04:36:00 - Considering CRDTs and Collaborative Editing

Briefly, Ryan addresses how conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) relate to reactive systems. In collaborative apps, multiple users might edit shared data, leading to merges or concurrent patches. He posits that store-based reactivity could interact with CRDT logic to update the UI instantly, while still maintaining a robust conflict resolution layer behind the scenes.

He notes that CRDT usage remains a specialized niche, but it exemplifies how reactivity must handle partial merges or distributed data. A store with granular signals could feed seamlessly into a CRDT engine, reconciling changes from multiple authors. While not a mainstream scenario, it underscores reactivity’s flexibility in advanced use cases. Ryan suggests that future efforts could see frameworks more directly supporting collaborative patterns if demand grows.

### 04:42:00 - Summaries of Immutable Patching vs. Mutable Merging

Reiterating earlier points, Ryan outlines how immutable patching, popularized by Redux, uses a before-and-after snapshot to compute changes. This is great for debugging, time travel, or revertible operations. Meanwhile, mutable merging modifies data in place, which can skip overhead but complicates advanced features like undo or concurrency. He emphasizes that each style has distinct use cases.

In library design, deciding which approach to favor can define the entire developer experience. Ryan says Solid leans mutable for performance but aims to provide enough tools so developers can implement time travel or advanced patches if they choose. He clarifies that no approach “wins” absolutely. Instead, devs weigh whether their app requires advanced debugging or distributed editing. Each team’s choice shapes how they handle data flow day to day.

### 04:48:00 - Next Steps for Solid’s 2.0

Ryan offers a glimpse into future changes in Solid’s next major release. He talks about unifying certain primitives to reduce confusion around createSignal vs. createStore. The new system might let signals handle nested data more gracefully or provide memo-like behavior by default. However, he is cautious about introducing complexity, highlighting the importance of stable, well-documented patterns.

He mentions that user feedback drives many of these changes. If certain usage patterns repeatedly trip people up, the team might incorporate clearer guidelines or new helper functions. Ryan is determined to avoid bloat or duplicating efforts while still refining the edges where mutable reactivity can become unwieldy. The conversation points to an ongoing effort: evolving the library with real-world insights rather than chasing theoretical completeness.

### 04:54:00 - Wrapping Up Advanced Reactive Patterns

Ryan summarizes key insights on reactivity: the interplay between immutability and mutability, the necessity of careful merges, async concurrency, and controlling partial states. He highlights that advanced reactivity is less about a single code snippet and more about engineering entire data flows, from server responses to final UI updates. This end-to-end perspective makes frameworks like Solid stand out.

He closes this segment by reflecting on the balance between developer ergonomics and the raw power of fine-grained updates. Too much abstraction can obscure how signals truly propagate changes; too little leads to manual merges everywhere. Ryan wants the sweet spot: tools that handle common cases elegantly but let experts optimize for specialized needs. These reflections prime listeners for final Q&A or concluding remarks on the overall significance of these patterns.

### 05:00:00 - Addressing Listener Questions and Comments

Ryan spends time acknowledging live chat participants who pose questions about resource usage, browser scheduling, or the viability of big concurrency models in smaller applications. He reiterates that many complexities around concurrency or advanced memo logic matter primarily for large, data-intensive apps. For simpler use cases, standard signals or a store are often enough to achieve noticeable performance improvements.

He also touches on memory usage, explaining that while signals hold snapshots, frameworks like Solid automatically drop references when they’re no longer relevant. This fosters confidence for devs who might worry about big memory leaks in single-page apps. The final takeaway is that correct usage patterns and lifecycle management ensure that Solid’s reactive model stays lightweight, whether building a small widget or a major enterprise platform.

### 05:06:00 - Revisiting Real-World Examples

Ryan recalls various real-world scenarios, from building a Trello-like interface to high-performance dashboards. He notes how each example revealed corner cases in the reactivity model. For instance, reconciling partial data from a server for a Kanban board might demand a custom approach that merges or discards partial subsets. In each case, controlling data at a fine-grained level lowered CPU usage and improved perceived performance.

He cites smaller side projects that also benefit from granular signals, demonstrating that these patterns aren’t just for huge apps. Even a personal notes app can instantly reflect changes without rerendering the entire list or top-level components. The discussion underscores that real-world success stories resonate more than theoretical benchmarks, giving devs the reassurance to experiment with advanced reactivity.

### 05:12:00 - Developer Tools and Debugging

Listeners ask about dev tools that can trace reactive flows. Ryan affirms that Solid’s dev tools continue to evolve, providing a tree of signals and effects that track updates in real time. He compares this to React’s dev tools, which show component re-renders but not the underlying dependency graph. Tools that show exactly which signals cause which updates can be invaluable when debugging performance or odd state transitions.

He highlights that advanced debugging often uncovers hidden complexity. For instance, a single property update might trigger multiple memos if not carefully structured. Visualizing this helps devs refactor or reorder computations for efficiency. Ryan wraps this section with an optimistic note: as reactivity frameworks mature, their dev tools become more sophisticated, bridging the gap between raw performance gains and developer-friendly diagnostics.

### 05:18:00 - Wrapping Up the Data Flow Discussion

The conversation circles back to unify the various threads: from nested reactivity to scheduling, from filter/reduce challenges to concurrency and suspense. Ryan reiterates that “pulling it all together” means carefully choosing how to map, derive, and mutate data. The wrong combination can lead to confusion, while the right approach reaps significant performance rewards.

He offers guidance: start with simpler patterns—like straightforward signals or store writes—and only introduce advanced features if the codebase needs them. By layering complexity gradually, devs learn the framework’s intricacies without stumbling into pitfalls. This practical perspective helps both newcomers and advanced users handle real-world data flows.

### 05:24:00 - Reflecting on Industry Momentum

Ryan notes that with Angular, Vue, and Svelte all embracing signals-like reactivity, the broader ecosystem converges on the principle of minimal re-renders. He speculates that this shift will standardize patterns across frameworks, making it easier for devs to switch or share knowledge. At the same time, each framework retains unique design decisions about scheduling or default behavior.

He calls attention to possible future collaborations, or at least cross-pollination of ideas, among library authors. For instance, if Svelte’s compiler yields some insight on partial hydration, Solid might adapt that concept. Meanwhile, Solid’s granular store patterns could inspire future Vue additions. This synergy promises more powerful, consistent reactivity for the JavaScript community at large.

### 05:30:00 - Final Thoughts on Syntax Debates

Ryan addresses one last wave of comments on syntax, such as the cost-benefit of function calls vs. property accesses in signals. He reaffirms that while certain syntax details can reduce friction, they don’t fundamentally change how data flows. He advises devs to weigh short-term comfort against long-term maintainability. For example, the function style in Solid clarifies that reading a signal is an operation, which can be helpful psychologically.

He also mentions that advanced codebases can wrap signals in whatever pattern suits them, letting teams standardize on a `.get()` or `.value` style. Ultimately, frameworks shouldn’t live or die by these superficial differences. The real deciding factor is whether the reactivity model handles your data scale gracefully. This pragmatic stance sums up much of Ryan’s viewpoint on library design and adoption.

### 05:36:00 - Community Q&A: Real vs. Hypothetical Features

The session shifts to an open Q&A segment. Listeners ask about hypothetical next-gen features, from typed signals to automatic concurrency. Ryan mentions that while typed signals might improve developer experience, it’s challenging to unify them with dynamic JavaScript. Automatic concurrency also risks unpredictable states. He underscores that each feature must solve real pain points without introducing confusion.

He shares anecdotes of how well-intentioned features in older libraries complicated daily usage. Ultimately, each improvement should flow from user feedback, not just theoretical desire. The conversation reaffirms Ryan’s iterative philosophy for Solid: address proven problems first, maintain minimal overhead, and guide users toward the library’s best practices.

### 05:42:00 - Revisiting the “Svelte 5 Looks Like React” Debate

Ryan fields a recurring question: does Svelte 5’s new syntax and ruin blocks make it “more like React”? He clarifies that while certain superficial aspects, such as function-based blocks, mirror React, the underlying logic remains compile-time. Svelte’s transformations differ from Solid’s runtime signals or React’s virtual DOM approach. So “looking like React” misses the deeper architectural differences.

He extends this logic to Vue’s composition API or Angular signals. All have function-based appearances, yet the update mechanics vary widely. He urges devs not to conflate superficial syntax with the entire system. The real question is how effectively each framework handles partial rendering or concurrency, not how the code looks in an isolated snippet. This clarifies that the industry is standardizing function syntax but diverging in reactivity internals.

### 05:48:00 - Closing Remarks and Parting Advice

In the final moments, Ryan thanks the viewers for joining this extended discussion. He reiterates key learnings: signals excel at fine-grained updates; asynchronous concurrency requires careful scheduling or suspense; merging external data is easy to do incorrectly unless you use the right patterns. He also mentions broader ecosystem developments—like Svelte’s new release or Vue’s ongoing evolution—indicating there’s a wealth of reactivity knowledge to explore.

He signs off by encouraging experimentation and community engagement. Whether someone chooses React, Svelte, Vue, or Solid, understanding reactivity at a fundamental level can boost productivity in any framework. He briefly alludes to further streams or articles on advanced topics like store patches, concurrency, and dev tools, concluding with optimism about the future of truly reactive architectures. With that, the session wraps up, leaving listeners equipped for deeper exploration of modern JavaScript reactivity.
