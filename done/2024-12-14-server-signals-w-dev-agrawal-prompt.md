Here, Dev and the host reflect on Meteor’s groundbreaking features, such as live data sync across the client and server. They explain how Meteor’s approach, though ahead of its time, lacked robust solutions for scaling with technologies like serverless or big data.  

The conversation underscores Meteor’s tracker system, revealing early attempts to unify the client and server’s data flow through “pub/sub” mechanics. While those concepts didn’t take over the broader market, they seeded the interest in modern frameworks aiming to unify real-time reactivity with partial or full SSR strategies.

### 24:00 – 30:00 | Server Components vs. Server Signals

The chat transitions to React Server Components and how they differ from live reactivity approaches. The host points out that RSC attempts to unify client and server code but lacks persistent connectivity. Dev underscores how “server signals” might make stateful servers possible, contrasting them with RSC’s stateless boundaries.  

They also hint at potential future directions, mentioning how frameworks like Qwik or Marko have toyed with resumable concepts that could pair with server signals. The discussion sets up deeper dives into how such systems would handle concurrency, streaming, and updates.

### 30:00 – 36:00 | Introducing Solid Socket and Dev’s Work

Dev provides an overview of his latest library, Solid Socket, which extends Solid Start with WebSocket-based synchronization. Using an example of a shared counter, he demonstrates how the library keeps multiple clients in sync with minimal boilerplate.  

They remark on how this approach preserves the developer experience of local signals while routing changes through a shared, stateful server process. The host expresses excitement about simplifying distributed real-time apps, something that historically required specialized tooling like LiveView or Meteor.

### 36:00 – 42:00 | Practical Considerations and Scaling

Attention turns to the scaling question: how does a WebSocket-based persistent approach handle thousands of connections? Dev shares comparisons with solutions from Elixir’s LiveView and emphasises node’s inherent event-driven model. They recognize that scaling real-time systems often involves trade-offs, highlighting the emergent interest in solutions such as Cloudflare Durable Objects.

### 42:00 – 48:00 | Collaborative Demos: Presence and Real-Time Updates

Dev showcases presence tracking as an example feature. By broadcasting user cursors or statuses in real time, he illustrates how small amounts of state can greatly enhance user experience in team applications. A few lines of code—signals on the server with minimal ceremony—achieve what older frameworks needed extensive boilerplate for.  

They also discuss further expansions: real-time dashboards, partial offline experiences, and continuous deployments. The host praises Dev’s solutions for bridging the user experience gap that has existed in real-time state management, historically requiring specialized libraries or heavy abstractions.

### 48:00 – 54:00 | Reconciling, Durable Objects, and Potential Pitfalls

The host raises topics like concurrency, conflict resolution, and how server signals differ from purely immutable or client-managed states. Dev explains that merging updates is easier when the server is authoritative, but certain edge cases remain.  

They briefly touch on possibilities for hooking reactivity into a system like Cloudflare’s Durable Objects. Both note that while it’s promising, widespread adoption may hinge on standardizing these advanced server-oriented concepts. They conclude that real-time syncing demands both a well-designed library and an underlying runtime that can handle ephemeral connections gracefully.

### 54:00 – 60:00 | Deeper into Conflict Resolution and Sync Engines

The conversation continues with advanced scenarios where users can queue multiple updates or operate offline, requiring specialized ways to track version conflicts. Dev references CRDTs and event logs, recalling how Meteor or older systems used similar structures.  

They discuss whether the problem is generalizable or must always be application-specific. The host observes that devs often just accept “eventual consistency” as enough, but as apps grow more collaborative, more refined solutions like transaction logs or partial concurrency logic become essential.

### 60:00 – 66:00 | Envisioning the Future: A Real-Time-Ready Ecosystem

At this point, they imagine a world where the default approach to building apps includes a simplified path to real-time reactivity. Server signals, or some refined variant, might become standard. Dev highlights the difficulty of bridging every edge case but remains optimistic about incremental improvements, especially with help from community experiments.  

Reflecting on older frameworks, they suggest it may take an entire ecosystem shift—both in tooling and infrastructure—to normalize stateful server connections. The host sees potential synergy with new deployment environments, such as partykit or jam socket, that revolve around ephemeral node-like processes for global sync.

### 66:00 – 72:00 | Quick Segue into Solid’s Future

The conversation pivots to the broader solid ecosystem. The host recalls the impetus for building advanced features like createProjection or better store mutation for complex data flows. Dev relates these developments to his experiments with presence and partial updates, highlighting their synergy with signals.  

They note that while not everyone needs deep concurrency solutions, having it accessible fosters creativity. They also preview upcoming next steps for solid, including refined reactivity, possible new store patterns, and reevaluations of features like partial hydration or server functions.

### 72:00 – 78:00 | Solid Sockets: Technical Underpinnings

They return specifically to Solid Socket’s mechanics, discussing the Babel plugin that allows the server to treat signals seamlessly. Dev notes that while signals were originally designed for client scenarios, enabling them on the server required minimal but crucial changes, like reintroducing certain transformations that the runtime usually avoids.  

Technical intricacies of hooking up events or presence data—like reading client signals on the server—are laid out. The host underscores that by aligning with existing patterns, developers gain real-time powers without rewriting their mental model.

### 78:00 – 84:00 | A Deeper Example: Presence in a Collaborative To-Do App

Dev recounts a to-do list demo, where multiple clients see changes in real time, including cursor sharing. The host praises the minimal code required to achieve a multi-user scenario. They compare it to older approaches in which websockets demanded custom store logic or manual subscription.  

Listeners also learn how advanced synchronization can remain modular. Dev points out that presence is just a single example: the same patterns can be extended to chat, collaborative text editing, or concurrency-laden dashboards.

### 84:00 – 90:00 | Scaling Real-Time Projects with Infrastructure

They loop back to the complexities of scaling, acknowledging that a single server with in-memory signals works nicely, but horizontal scaling is more complex. Dev outlines a prospective approach—persisted signals—tying them to on-storage watchers or a shared DB.  

Though not trivial, the approach allows signals to replicate across multiple server instances. The host reiterates that big concurrency solutions often require advanced runtime features. Yet these partial solutions are valuable for smaller apps or proof-of-concepts, bridging a key gap in developer experience.

### 90:00 – 96:00 | Bridging Offline, Event Logs, and CRDTs

The conversation moves toward local-first or offline-friendly designs. They highlight how advanced event-based architectures can unify client, server, and data store updates. Dev details using logs that automatically replicate. This pattern, though flexible, leaves conflict resolution up to user-defined logic.  

The host acknowledges the complexity, noting how Elm or RxJS tried to unify push-based flows. They see a continuum, from purely local to purely server-driven, but realize each approach demands nuance for partial merges or reordering of updates.

### 96:00 – 102:00 | Wrapping Up Real-Time Solutions

Here, they begin summarizing the main takeaways on real-time reactivity. Dev emphasizes that the newest generation of tools aims to keep code simple while offering advanced collaborative features.

They briefly mention the synergy with new ephemeral hosting models, repeating that signals can pair with technologies like Cloudflare Durable Objects for large-scale concurrency. Concluding this segment, both agree that more experimentation and real-world usage will refine the approach.

### 102:00 – 108:00 | Introduction to Solid Events

The host prompts Dev to discuss another library: Solid Events. Dev outlines how events differ from signals, focusing on a push-based stream of discrete updates. They recall how older FRP frameworks distinguished continuous behaviors from discrete events, and how modern signals lean toward behaviors.  

Solid Events let users define event emitters or topics, seamlessly hooking them into Solid’s reactive graph. By bridging these two worlds, developers can reason about state changes more precisely, especially for one-off or synchronous triggers.

### 108:00 – 114:00 | Creating a Shared Syntax for Signals and Events

Dev delves further into the event library’s design, highlighting how it sidesteps the need for constant re-checking. Instead, events can coordinate concurrency or advanced logic, reminiscent of RxJS but with a simpler API. The host references older attempts at bridging streams with signals, acknowledging complexities around repeated values or quick consecutive triggers.  

They illustrate how separate primitives for “pull-based” signals and “push-based” events can yield a cleaner mental model, especially for advanced real-time tasks. The host is intrigued by the potential for combining these with store or partial hydration features.

### 114:00 – 120:00 | Event Composition and FRP Heritage

They map out parallels to FRP concepts from Haskell, Elm, and older JavaScript libraries. Dev shows sample code that uses event transformations, partitions, or merges, akin to streams. While reminiscent of RxJS, the host underscores that the new library stays smaller and more targeted for Solid’s needs.  

Listeners hear how these compositional techniques reduce dependence on side effects. In place of hooking signals with effects manually, devs can rely on event chains for a more explicit data flow.

### 120:00 – 126:00 | The Drag-and-Drop Example

Dev demonstrates a drag-and-drop scenario using events rather than raw signals or large sets of side effects. The code, though verbose, clarifies each step: mousedown, mousemove, drop acceptance. The host notes that, for complex interactions, purely reactive styles can become tricky.  

They compare to older Angular or RxJS patterns, seeing parallels but also praising the simpler structure that emerges when events handle branching logic. This approach can help maintain a cleaner, more analyzable code graph for user interactions.

### 126:00 – 132:00 | Observing Different Takes on Reactivity

The two reflect on how frameworks approach reactivity differently. Solid focuses on straightforward signals and direct mutations, while React relies heavily on immutability and re-renders. Libraries like RxJS pivoted entirely on push-based streams.  

Dev’s new library merges aspects from both push and pull systems, hoping to solve advanced real-time tasks without burying users in operators. The host acknowledges that writing such code can be more verbose but yields transparent, easily testable logic.

### 132:00 – 138:00 | Event Subscriptions, Listeners, and Memory Cleanup

They walk through the library’s technical details for subscribing and unsubscribing. Dev underscores how Solid’s root disposal naturally handles event subscriptions, preventing memory leaks. The host muses that simpler memory management was a hallmark of older frameworks like Meteor, praising how these patterns still hold up in modern contexts.  

They also consider performance: events can reduce overhead by preventing signals from updating on repeated identical values, thus sparing the system from unnecessary computations.

### 138:00 – 144:00 | The Synergy of Events and Local-First Strategies

Dev revisits the synergy between events and store patterns, explaining how local-first logs can feed into an event-based aggregator. The host draws parallels to state machines or semantic data flows, emphasizing that an event-sourced system might be simpler to reason about.  

They also touch upon offline capabilities: an event-based model can queue, replay, or reorder changes with minimal fuss. Combined with signals, it can efficiently unify ephemeral states with persistent logs for a robust real-time approach.

### 144:00 – 150:00 | Potential Compiler Hooks and Resumability

The host wonders if signals plus events open new doors for compilers, referencing how the Quick or Marko teams approach resumability. They imagine a scenario where the compiler statically tracks event chains for code-splitting or eliminating closures, thus simplifying hydration or partial rendering.  

Dev agrees that advanced static analysis could further cut overhead, but acknowledges that it’s an open research area. The conversation underscores how bundling and lazy loading must not disrupt the event ordering or logic.

### 150:00 – 156:00 | Wrapping Up Solid Events and Future Directions

They near the end of Dev’s library showcase, summing up how Solid Events can tackle user interactions, real-time features, or complex concurrency. The host thanks Dev for the in-depth look, pointing out how the synergy with server signals is especially powerful.

The host then transitions to his personal research on stores, referencing prior streams about patching and diffing in immutable versus mutable systems. He mentions working on bridging the gap between ephemeral updates and persisted references.  

As an example, he describes hooking signals to store data that can be seamlessly updated without rewriting everything in place. This leads to a discussion of reconciling new data while preserving existing object references, ensuring minimal overhead and fewer re-renders.

### 186:00 – 192:00 | Immutability vs. Mutability Revisited

They talk about immutable approaches like Redux, which rely on shallow checks, contrasted with the granular updates that signals afford. The host shares his long-running effort to unify the best of both worlds.  

Dev acknowledges how complexity arises when partial updates demand both stable references for performance and selective object replacement for concurrency. They point to real scenarios—like large forms or partial refreshes—where the store must integrate incremental updates quickly and safely.

### 192:00 – 198:00 | Potential Solutions for Store Reconciliation

The host outlines a technique for comparing incoming data with existing store references, conditionally swapping out objects if they differ, while preserving stable references. He sees this as an evolution of the reconcile function that can handle repeated merges or expansions.  

They note that the approach helps time-travel scenarios or advanced debugging, reminiscent of Redux’s dev tools. Yet, the host concedes that the solution took extensive trial and error, referencing performance experiments run on UI bench or other advanced benchmarks.

### 198:00 – 204:00 | Benchmarking Adventures

Here, the host delves into the complexities of framework benchmarks, recounting unexpected results when simulating large data sets. He mentions that certain changes ironically made the code slower in typical merges but faster in corner cases.  

Dev empathizes with the frustration of balancing code illusions and real-world usage. They acknowledge that perfect micro-optimizations rarely exist. Instead, a strategic approach ensures that day-to-day performance remains robust, regardless of the outliers in large, theoretical benchmarks.

### 204:00 – 210:00 | Addressing Scaled Insertions and Large Tables

They further dissect test scenarios like DBMon, highlighting how older solutions like Inferno or even highly optimized compilers approach massive data updates differently. The host clarifies that once signals can skip unnecessary subtrees, store overhead drops.  

Nevertheless, in extreme cases, frameworks reliant on VDOM or partial clones may still handle large merges more gracefully. Both express optimism, though, about future store enhancements bridging any performance gap left in special edge cases.

### 210:00 – 216:00 | Introducing a New Reconciliation Method

The host demonstrates a hypothetical “double-pointer” or “reference-swapping” approach in store proxies. By internally storing an unwrapped object, the store can unify immutability’s clarity and signals’ efficiency.  

Dev finds this technique interesting, noting that it might preserve stable references while also short-circuiting deeper merges. The host is eager to confirm results in real applications, hoping it ushers in a new wave of simpler, more intuitive store usage across the Solid ecosystem.

### 216:00 – 222:00 | Challenges of Top-Level Identity Changes

They confront a subtle limitation: reconciling entirely different objects at the top level. The host clarifies that unique IDs typically indicate a true swap, whereas reusing the same ID triggers a merge. If devs attempt to coerce distinct items into the same identity, confusion arises.  

Dev suggests that future store improvements may require explicit “replace vs. update” signals. They emphasize consistent patterns—like normalizing data by IDs—to avoid messy merges. This discussion underscores how front-end data shapes the entire development approach.

### 222:00 – 228:00 | Summarizing the Store Breakthrough

They wrap up the store conversation, noting that while certain design constraints remain, the new reference-swapping approach feels promising. The host likens it to rebase logic from version control: an incoming state merges into an existing tree, preserving references for performance.  

Dev applauds the meticulous approach, admiring how it retains Solid’s hallmark fine-grained updates. They see this as a long-awaited puzzle piece. Both express optimism that it will soon land in the official libraries, further simplifying advanced data flows.

### 228:00 – 234:00 | Hierarchical Reactive Scheduling Boundaries

Switching gears, the host talks about hierarchical scheduling for reactivity, explaining the notion of multiple phases—pure computations, render effects, user effects—and how some might skip if suspended. Using examples of off-screen or partially deferred updates, he envisions a nested queue system controlling each phase.  

They compare it to a layered approach, letting components pause or skip entire reactivity trees. Dev sees parallels to existing off-screen or keep-alive solutions from other frameworks, praising the potential for advanced resource optimization.

### 234:00 – 240:00 | Off-Screen Components

The host shares a small demo toggling entire subtrees off and on, revealing how signals only update relevant subgraphs. Dev suggests a future scenario where large sections of the UI remain “frozen” to spare CPU usage.  

They mention frameworks that tried partial hydration or partial unmount, but highlight how deeper reactivity is more precise. In the host’s vision, hierarchical scheduling boundaries unify suspense, off-screen, and time slicing in a single universal approach.

### 240:00 – 246:00 | Outlook on Hierarchical Scheduling

They discuss how this new layering might interact with concurrency, transactions, or partial rendering. While acknowledging complicated edge cases, the host reiterates that the fundamental logic—shifting from global to nested scheduling—promises more targeted updates.  

Dev agrees, noting that once these features mature, devs can easily incorporate advanced transitions or idle-time updates. The host assures that actual library APIs will likely remain simple, hiding these complexities under the hood for typical use cases.

### 246:00 – 252:00 | Last Bits of Reactivity 2.0

They muse that between store improvements, event-based patterns, and scheduling boundaries, the core of “Solid 2.0 reactivity” is nearly complete. The host outlines a path for suspense refinements and small bug fixes, anticipating a stable final form.  

Dev expresses excitement for the synergy these features offer, from simpler off-screen to robust concurrency. They see immediate applications, especially in collaborative apps or feature-laden experiences that must juggle partial states.

### 252:00 – 258:00 | Revisiting React Server Components

The host briefly mentions ongoing queries about RSC and how they differ. He alludes to a conversation with other library authors about partial rehydration and potential concurrency. This ties back to the speculation that reactivity’s server approach might overshadow some RSC use cases.  

Dev notes that the overlap in server data logic or partial updates remains a lively area. While React paved the way for universal server rendering, signals-based servers might prove more intuitive for advanced real-time workflows.

### 258:00 – 264:00 | Final Thoughts on the Larger JavaScript Ecosystem

They pan out to the broader JavaScript world, reflecting on how quickly frameworks shift. The host mentions next-generation tools adopting partial hydration, partial reactivity, or advanced bundling. Dev reaffirms that the crucial factor is solving real developer problems with minimal friction.  

They also remark on user confusion about multiple new frameworks claiming to solve the same issues. Over time, clearer patterns emerge, especially around stable references, concurrency, and partial updates—areas where signals continue to stand out.

### 264:00 – 270:00 | React Scan and Performance Awareness

The host comments on ongoing discussions about React’s re-render patterns, referencing a utility that visualizes re-renders. Dev chimes in on how signals often bypass the repetitive overhead. Nonetheless, they clarify that React can remain performant in many real-world apps.  

They conclude that if devs only measure performance via re-renders, they might be misled. In practice, frameworks balance various trade-offs. The host, however, still sees value in precise updates, reaffirming solid’s philosophy of changing only what’s necessary.

### 270:00 – 276:00 | Astro, Vite 6, and the Broader Meta Framework Scene

They pivot to praising recent meta framework releases, including Astro 5’s server islands, TanStack Start’s beta, and Vite 6’s environment API. Dev underscores how these modern tools simplify bridging the server-client gap.
